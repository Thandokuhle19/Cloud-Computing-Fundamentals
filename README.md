# Cloud-Computing-Fundamentals
_What is the cloud?_
- Cloud computing has revolutionized businesses by offering on-demand computing power, unlimited scalability, and flexible pricing models.
- Startups disrupt established players, while established businesses enhance capabilities and processes.
- Initially focused on cost reduction, companies now recognize cloud services' potential for business transformation.
- Hybrid cloud strategies combine public and private cloud services, retaining critical applications in data centers.
- Cloud computing is a term often misunderstood due to its various offerings and vendor names, and can be understood by identifying five key characteristics.
- On-Demand Self-Service: Consumers can provision resources automatically in cloud services, such as compute power, storage, websites, and database services, without direct interaction with the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
- Broad Network Access: Cloud-based services are accessible across the network, including local on-premises networks, the Internet, or both, and can be globally accessible through client devices and traditional server deployments.
- Resource Pooling: A cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model, adjusts resource allocation on-demand, and abstracts hardware distribution from consumers. They pool network, storage, and compute capabilities, managing resources and maximizing their use without physical location awareness.
- Rapid Elasticity: Resource provisioning and release can be automatic or manual. Traditional models purchase server resources as capital expenditures, with fixed costs and capabilities. Cloud-based computing dynamically allocates resources, allowing efficient utilization of underutilized servers and eliminating the need for costly maintenance.
- Measured Service: CSPs utilize metering for efficient resource allocation and accurate billing, ensuring that consumers are accurately billed for the quantity of resources consumed.

# Cloud Computing Ecosystems
_Cloud Computing Ecosystem_
- It is essential to understand that an ecosystem of participants defines the market.
- This ecosystem consists of three categories of plays:
                 - Consumers of Services: Cloud services are essential for everyday end-users,                        like yourself or colleagues, who need the capabilities to perform their tasks.                     Examples include Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, and Apple's iCloud. These                       services allow users to store, share, and access files from various devices,                       including PCs, Macs, and mobiles. Users may not fully understand the service's                     location or design, but they need the capabilities to perform their tasks                          effectively.
                 - Provider of Services: Cloud providers offer various functions, including infrastructure services, applications, and tools. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, and Alibaba Cloud are prominent examples. AWS provides computing power, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning, and more. Microsoft Azure manages applications and services through managed data centers. Google Cloud Platform provides infrastructure, storage, AI, machine learning, data analytics, and more. Alibaba Cloud is Alibaba Group's cloud computing arm.
                  - Designer of Services: Companies like Accenture, Deloitte, Capgemini, IBM, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Cognizant, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and DXC Technology specialize in designing and implementing cloud technologies. They offer consulting and implementation services for cloud architecture, migration, and management, as well as cloud transformation services. Accenture focuses on cloud architecture, migration, and management, while Deloitte assists in developing cloud strategies and architectures. Capgemini focuses on cloud transformation, while IBM focuses on hybrid cloud architectures and AI and blockchain. PwC helps businesses design and implement cloud strategies, optimize operations, and ensure compliance. TCS assists in cloud strategy development, architecture design, and application implementation.

_Understanding Cloud Concepts_
- Cloud computing offers shared computing resources, including applications, storage, networking, development, and deployment platforms, and streamlines business processes through standardization and automation.
- This approach ensures consistent service implementation with consistent interfaces, while automation is required for process implementation in the cloud.
- Automation is a process that triggers based on business rules, resource availability, and security demands to support self-service provisioning models.
- It helps in capacity planning and workload management by returning provisioned services to the resource pool when they are no longer needed.
- Most businesses today use some kind of cloud service, such as Microsoft 365, Slack, or DocuSign, online data backup, collaboration services, and open community cloud platforms like LinkedIn.
- Companies are also discovering that having Customer Relationship Management (CRM) as a service is a better way to support their sales team than traditional on-premises software options.
- Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing power, infrastructure, applications, business processes, and personal collaboration as a service.
- To be operational in the real world, the cloud must be implemented with standardized processes and automation.
- For example, the course is hosted on a cloud platform called edX, with servers located anywhere in the world.
- The learning system is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is located in Portland, United States. To learn more, use a Site Hosting Checker tool.

# Understanding Cloud Deployment Models
_Cloud Components and Clients_
- Cloud services solutions consist of three main components: the client platform, the data center hosting the services, and the network connection between them.
- Leading cloud service providers like Microsoft and Amazon operate a vast network of data centers worldwide, designed with redundancy for reliable power supply, internet connectivity, and physical security.
- These data centers host various functionalities, catering to both individuals and businesses.
- Cloud services can include storage, email, e-commerce, office suites, and development environments.
- Users can access these services from various devices, including phones, tablets, traditional computers, IoT devices, and servers.
- The primary operating systems used on these devices include Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
- Cloud service infrastructure can be managed internally by a single organization or by a CSP providing services to multiple organizations.
- These models can be combined into a hybrid solution.
- The network connects client devices to CSPs' data centers, providing a private and dedicated connection.
- Access to cloud services can be facilitated through the internet or cell connections.
- Organizations may use a combination of all three network connection types depending on their specific needs and requirements.
- Cloud service infrastructure can be managed by a single organization for its own use or by a CSP that provides services to multiple organizations.
- The two models can be combined into a hybrid solution:
                      - Public cloud: CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. The customers share the public cloud's reasources without knowing precisely where their dat ais in relation that of any other organization.
                      - Private cloud: Services are provided only a single organization.
                      - Hybrid cloud: There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments.
- Clouds come in various versions, with two primary deployment models: public and private.
- Organizations typically use a hybrid cloud environment, combining private computing resources and public services, where some services interact, resulting in a more efficient and cost-effective solution for their needs.
- Multicloud environments are popular among organizations due to their ability to support different developer and business units using various public cloud services, allowing developers to access their preferred platform and businesses to move between vendors.

_The Public Cloud_
- Public cloud refers to a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by a third party (CSP) for use by other companies or individuals.
- CSPs offer public cloud services through subscription models, creating a highly scalable data center that hides the details of the underlying infrastructure from customers.
- They dynamically reallocate resources throughout the data center to support current demand.
- Public clouds are viable because they offer many options for computing, storage, and a rich set of other services.
- Consumers can quickly select, optimize, and use resources that match the needs of their applications in the public cloud.
- Most public cloud providers offer a wide variety of APIs and services, such as security and specialized infrastructure to support specific workloads.
- Dedicated, non-multi-tenancy instances within a cloud vendor's data center are becoming more popular.
- These instances assign users their own machines and storage within the vendor's data center, but may not have the same cost savings as a multi-tenancy approach.
- Amazon and Microsoft are two major public cloud vendors, though they also offer private cloud deployment options.

_The Private Cloud_
- A private cloud is a set of hardware, networking, storage, services, applications, and interfaces owned and operated by an organization for its employees, partners, or customers.
- It can be created and managed by a third party for the exclusive use of one enterprise, allowing the organization to leverage cloud technologies while maintaining complete control.
- This highly controlled environment is particularly viable for large enterprises.

_The Hybrid and Multicloud Model_
- A hybrid I is a combination of private and public cloud services to solve business problems.
- It aims to create a unified, automated, and well-managed computing environment.
- Multicloud is when multiple public clouds are used within an organization, providing visibility, control, and choice between clouds.
- This is the definition of corporate computing, where multiple public and private services are combined to create value.
- Not all companies use both public and private cloud services.
- In the following circumstances, a computing environment is not a hybrid or multicloud:
                            - The company does not have a hybrid environment if there are little developers in a company use a public cloud service to prototype a new application that is completely disconnected from the private cloud or the data center.
                            - Environment is not hybrid if a company is using SaaS application for a project but there is no movement of data from that application into the company's data center.
                            - If different divisions within an enterprise are standardized on different public cloud infrastructures, but each division only utilizes and manages a single public cloud.
- A cloud is hybrid or multi in the following situations:
                        - If a company uses a public development platform that sends data to a private cloud or a data center-based application, the cloud is hybrid.
                        - When a company leverages a number of SaaS applications and moves data between private or data center resources, the cloud is hybrid.
                        - When a business process is designed as a service so that it can connect with environments as though they were a single environment, the cloud is hybrid.
                        - When a SaaS analytics platform is used and data from multiple cloud sources are ingested.
                        - When your organization can move workloads to different public clouds based on cost or performance concerns.

_Cloud Within a Cloud (Virtual Private Cloud)_
- Known as virtual private cloud (VPC), are single-tenant deployments where an organization's cloud services are hosted by a public CSP in an isolated segment, with full administrative responsibility, despite shared resources with other companies.
- Here are some key differences:
                - VPC: logical isolation of the cloud deployment that resides on a CSP's infrastructure (and is therefore scalable).
                - Private cloud: physical isolation of the cloud deployment in a private data center, a community data center, or CSP's infrastructure. It is limited by the available hardware and therefore less scalable.

_What is a Virtual Private Cloud?_
- 

_Multitenancy_
- This is the concept behind public cloud deployments.
- Multiple consumers, known as tenants, share computing resources owned and managed by the CSP
- This is the opposite idea from a VPC deployment.
- It is multitenancy that provides the cost benefits behind shared resource utilization.

_Multi-cloud_
- Multi-cloud deployments combine cloud services from multiple public and private CSPs, offering flexibility, choice, data control, and disaster mitigation, reducing reliance on a single vendor.

_Cloud Computing Elements: Resource Pools/Cloud Models and Services_
- Infrastructure technology resources like processors, storage, and networking are essential, but also include software services like databases and email servers.
- These services are typically built as a shared, multi-tenant service in cloud environments.
- This architecture allows customers to share computing resources, but their individual configurations and data are isolated.
- This approach is beneficial for cloud providers and software vendors, as it allows for shared infrastructure and saves software data, settings, and preferences.

# Cloud Delivery Models
- Cloud services offload responsibility from traditional client-server models, allowing companies to manage servers, storage, and networking more easily.
- This model allows for the offloading of these responsibilities to a cloud service provider, simplifying business needs.
- In this section, we focus on the models that represent computing environment services:
                            - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The consumer manages hardware infrastructure, firmware updates, device drivers, and compatibility, installs and manages the operating system, and assumes responsibility for all layers above it.
                            - Platform as a Service (PaaS): The CSP provides a service structure, but consumer management and content responsibility are up to them, while the CSP handles hardware and service platform support.
                            - Software as Service (SaaS): he consumer is being provided with the direct use of the software. Responsibility for the hardware where that software runs, the operating system upon which it runs, and the installation and patching of the software itself are all offloaded to the CSP.
