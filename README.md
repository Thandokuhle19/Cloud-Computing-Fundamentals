# Cloud-Computing-Fundamentals
_What is the cloud?_
- Cloud computing has revolutionized businesses by offering on-demand computing power, unlimited scalability, and flexible pricing models.
- Startups disrupt established players, while established businesses enhance capabilities and processes.
- Initially focused on cost reduction, companies now recognize cloud services' potential for business transformation.
- Hybrid cloud strategies combine public and private cloud services, retaining critical applications in data centers.
- Cloud computing is a term often misunderstood due to its various offerings and vendor names, and can be understood by identifying five key characteristics.
- On-Demand Self-Service: Consumers can provision resources automatically in cloud services, such as compute power, storage, websites, and database services, without direct interaction with the Cloud Service Provider (CSP).
- Broad Network Access: Cloud-based services are accessible across the network, including local on-premises networks, the Internet, or both, and can be globally accessible through client devices and traditional server deployments.
- Resource Pooling: A cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model, adjusts resource allocation on-demand, and abstracts hardware distribution from consumers. They pool network, storage, and compute capabilities, managing resources and maximizing their use without physical location awareness.
- Rapid Elasticity: Resource provisioning and release can be automatic or manual. Traditional models purchase server resources as capital expenditures, with fixed costs and capabilities. Cloud-based computing dynamically allocates resources, allowing efficient utilization of underutilized servers and eliminating the need for costly maintenance.
- Measured Service: CSPs utilize metering for efficient resource allocation and accurate billing, ensuring that consumers are accurately billed for the quantity of resources consumed.

# Cloud Computing Ecosystems
_Cloud Computing Ecosystem_
- It is essential to understand that an ecosystem of participants defines the market.
- This ecosystem consists of three categories of plays:
